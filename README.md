# Jinzhan-Cafeteria-AI
## Introduction
This project is the final project of the course, "Introduction to Machine Learning", in National Tsinghua University.
We modify YOLOv7 to detect the food image from the cafeteria in our campus, "Jinzhan", and also use regression model to predict the price based on the detection result from YOLOv7 model.
